    "- Take the ForestTypes Dataset which has train and test as seperate files.\n",
    "- Combine the train and test as single file.\n",
    "- Perform Univariate analysis of features and draw your inferences from it\n",
    "- Use statistical test , apart from heatmap to get the collinearity among features\n",
    "- Draw relationships among 3-4 features and get insights from it\n",
    "- Make use of PCA in reducing the dimensionality\n",
    "- Use Min-Max Scaling of features, and plot the graph showing the difference before scaling and after scaling.\n",
    "- Verify the effect of C parameter and gamma function. Plot the accuracy of train and test score\n",
    "- Fine-tune the parameter in SVM by using GridSearchCV.\n"
